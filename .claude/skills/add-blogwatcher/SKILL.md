# Add Blogwatcher Plugin

This skill installs the [blogwatcher](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/blogwatcher) CLI binary inside the agent container so the agent can read and monitor RSS/Atom feeds on demand.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight

Check if `src/plugins/blogwatcher.ts` exists. If it does, skip to Phase 3 (Rebuild) — the code changes are already in place.

## Phase 2: Apply Code Changes

### Ensure plugin infrastructure exists

Check if `src/plugins/registry.ts` exists. If not, the plugin system hasn't been installed yet — this is unexpected since it ships with the core codebase. Stop and ask the user to check their installation.

### Write the plugin module

Look up the latest release at https://github.com/nicholasgasior/blogwatcher/releases and get the linux/amd64 binary URL. Then copy `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/add/src/blogwatcher.ts` to `src/plugins/blogwatcher.ts`, replacing `vX.Y.Z` in the URL with the actual version tag.

### Register in the plugins barrel

Merge `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/modify/src/plugins/index.ts` into `src/plugins/index.ts` by appending any lines from the skill file that are not already present.

### Create container skill

Copy `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/container/skills/blogwatcher/SKILL.md` to `container/skills/blogwatcher/SKILL.md`.

### Validate code changes

```bash
npm run build
```

Build must be clean before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Rebuild

The blogwatcher binary needs to be baked into the container image. The build script auto-generates `plugins/binaries.json` from the plugin registry before building — do not edit that file manually.

```bash
container/build.sh
```

### Restart the service

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw
```

## Phase 4: Verify

Ask the user to send a message to the agent:

> `run: blogwatcher --help`

The agent should respond with the blogwatcher help output.

## Troubleshooting

**`blogwatcher: command not found` inside the container**
The binary wasn't installed. Check that `binaryInstall` is declared in `src/plugins/blogwatcher.ts` and rebuild: `container/build.sh`

**Download failed during build**
Check that the URL in `binaryInstall.url` points to a valid release asset. Visit https://github.com/nicholasgasior/blogwatcher/releases to find the correct URL.
